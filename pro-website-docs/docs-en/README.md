  Ontology Application Products-Documentation Centre
</p>

[Ontology](https://ont.io/#/) puts forward a series of protocol standards. Proposals include an identity protocol, multi-source authentication protocol, user authorization protocol, distributed data exchange protocol and so on. Based on these protocols，Ontology provides products and frameworks for application developers to directly build distributed Apps without having any knowledge of how to develop a complicated distributed systems.This makes blockchain easy to use for everybody.

### You can get these product documentations as below：

* ONT ID 

ONT ID can establish a cryptographic digital identity for every user, company, object or any other entity. Digital identity is based on the Ontology blockchain technology and is not restricted by any centralized organizations. It is purely managed by the users themselves, and has the characteristics of security and credibility.

* ONTPass 

Based on ONT ID and Ontological trust eco-system, it is an open and decentralized authentication platform, providing various authentication services for people, assets, objects and events.

* Decentralized Data Exchange Application Framework(DDXF)

Based on the Ontology blockchain and ONT ID protocols, DDXF perfectly implements digital asset decentralized transactions through unified ledger, smart contracts, and cryptography. DDXF provides a series of smart contract templates, transaction components and cryptographic components. The front end application can easily implement data collaboration and sharing.

* Trust Anchor Connector

Trust Anchor refers to the partner that provides authentication services on the Ontology ecosystem.  Trust anchors can be government agencies, universities, banks, third-party authentication service agencies (such as CA agencies), biometric technology companies and etc. They provide multi-dimensional authentication for ONT ID owners by recording the HASH of authentication behavior and authentication result through the Ontology blockchain while providing a standardized and credible authentication method for the authentication requester.

Trust Anchor Connector(called for short:TAConnector) is a technology access component that helps Trust Anchors quickly access the Ontology trust ecosystem.
